I’m Andrew Kim, a New Yorker born and raised in Queens where I’ve spent most of my life. Shortly after I was born, I was sent to temporarily live with my uncle and grandmother in the suburbs of Daegu, South Korea before returning back to the states for elementary school.

I am best reached through email.
