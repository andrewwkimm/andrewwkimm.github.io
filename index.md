I'm Andrew Kim, a New Yorker born and raised in Queens where I've spent most of my life. 
Shortly after I was born, I lived with my uncle and grandmother in the Daegu suburbs of South Korea
before returning back to the states for elementary school.

I am best reached through [email](andrewkimka@gmail.com).
