      I am a Data Engineering Consultant for American Beauty Institute, a cosmetology school that offers certification education for various beauty-related fields, building their data platform from scratch to support their rapidly growing business as they expand in multiple locations.

      At The Table
    </p>
    <p>
      At The Table connects foster youth with educational resources. The executive director maintained multiple versions of a scorecard spreadsheet for partner organizations, a time-consuming process that took away from directly serving students. I developed a centralized web application that replaced the fragmented spreadsheet system with an intuitive interface accessible to non-technical audiences.

      This web app serves not only the staff and students in At The Table, but also <a href="https://fairfuturesny.org" target="_blank">Fair Futures</a> and students in <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/student-affairs/programs-services/foster-youth-college-success-initiative-fycsi/" target="_blank">CUNYâ€™s Foster Youth College Success Initiative</a>, among many other non-profits and foster care support organizations.
